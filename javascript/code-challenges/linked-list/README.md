# Singly Linked Lists

## Requirements

### Node

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

### Linked List

Create a Linked List class

- Within your Linked List class, include a head property.

- Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

- The class should contain the following methods

  - insert

  - Arguments: value

  - Returns: nothing

- Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

  - includes

  - Arguments: value

  - Returns: Boolean

- Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

  - to string

  - Arguments: none

  - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

#### Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be contextual, descriptive, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

##### Tests

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list

- Can properly insert into the linked list

- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list

- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list

- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists

- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist

- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
