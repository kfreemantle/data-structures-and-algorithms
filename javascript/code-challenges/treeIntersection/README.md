# Tree Intersection

This is a challenge to write an algorithm that will take two binary trees as an input and return a set of values common to both trees.

## Whiteboard

- tbd following TA help

### Approach/Efficiency

Space: O(n)
Time: O(m), which I had to look up to figure out how to call out increased complexity per unique value.

#### Solution

- npm run tree-intersection
