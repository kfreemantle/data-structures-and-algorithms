#### Approach

4/4/2023: I haven't completed this as I haven't written the code or the test cases in my whiteboard.  I have a pretty solid idea of how to proceed but I had to step away to deal with a family issue in the afternoon.  I'm submitting it incomplete for the moment and will finish tomorrow.
