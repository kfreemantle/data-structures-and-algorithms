# Breadth-First Traversal

## Author: Kyle Freemantle

This repository contains an implementation of a breadth-first traversal function for binary trees in JavaScript, along with test cases.

## Function Description

The `breadthFirst` function takes a binary tree as input and returns an array containing the values of the tree in the order they were encountered during the traversal. The function uses a breadth-first approach to traverse the tree.

### Test cases

The test suite includes the following cases:

Test that the function returns an array with the values in the order they were encountered.
Test that the function returns an empty array if the tree is empty.

To run the tests, from the repo root run `npm test breadthFirst`

#### Big O complexity

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
